## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


### Links

- Live Site URL: [ppcc-two.vercel.app](https://ppcc-two.vercel.app/)

## My process

i start with building the structure first the main containers, i give each container a unique  background color to see how its positioned
on desktop then i added media queries to see how containers behave on small devices.
next i added contents to containers finally i styled each element.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

i learned that you didn't learn something until you do something that makes sense with it. 
reading a code is one thing, writing is another thing. never underestimate nor overestimate anything regarding programming.
but you should give it a try before saying anything 

### Continued development

i used flex box but as the project keeps getting more complex there is a possibility of having multiple containers and managing them across different
break points might need combining box flex box and grid.
